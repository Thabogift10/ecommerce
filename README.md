# iPhone E-Commerce Website 📱

🚀 **Live Demo:** [https://bester-ecommerce.netlify.app](https://bester-ecommerce.netlify.app)

## Overview

This project is a **front-end iPhone e-commerce website** built as part of my **developer portfolio**. It simulates an online store where users can browse iPhone products, view details, and add items to a shopping cart.

The goal of this project was to strengthen my skills in **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**, and to demonstrate how a real-world online store could function on the client side.
